# AutoPinWindows
Automatically pin windows on secondary monitors and unpin windows on the main monitor.  

This is useful if you want to use virtual desktops on your main monitor, but want to keep your secondary monitors static, e.g. playing a video or showing a webpage.

# How to use?
Double click and run. The app runs as a tray icon app. The app goes idle after 5 seconds of no user input.

# Compatibility
Tested on Windows 10 21H2. Probably works on Windows 10 1809~21H2. Possibly works on Windows 11 and all Windows 10 versions after 1607.

# Compile environment
Visual Studio 2022 and .Net Framework 4.7.2.
